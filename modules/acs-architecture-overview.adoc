= {product-title} architecture overview

{product-title}({product-title-short}) uses a distributed architecture that supports high scale deployments and is optimized to minimize the impact on the underlying {ocp}(OCP) or Kubernetes nodes. You install {product-title-short} as a set of containers in your {ocp} or Kubernetes cluster. It includes services that you install on each cluster secured by RHACS and centralized services you install on one cluster.

== Centralized services
You install Centralized services on a single cluster (*Cluster 1* in _Figure 1_ and _2_). These services includes two main components, Central and Scanner.
However, when you install {product-title} on {ocp}, you also install a lightweight version of Scanner on each secured cluster (_Figure 1_) to enable scanning of images in the integrated OpenShift Container Registry (OCR).

* *Central*:
Central is the {product-title-short} application management interface and services.
It handles data persistence, API interactions, and user interface ({product-title-short} Portal) access.
You can use the same Central instance to secure multiple OpenShift Container Platform or Kubernetes clusters.
* *Scanner*:
Scanner is a Red Hat-developed and certified vulnerability scanner for scanning container images and their associated databases.
It analyzes all image layers to check known vulnerabilities from the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) list.
Scanner also identifies vulnerabilities in packages installed by package managers and in dependencies for multiple programming languages.

== Secured cluster services
You install the secured cluster services on each cluster that you want to secure by using the {product-title} (*Cluster N* in _Figure 1_ and _2_). Cluster where you install Central is also secured and includes these services.

* *Sensor*:
Sensor is the service responsible for analyzing and monitoring the cluster.
It handles interactions with the OpenShift Container Platform or Kubernetes API server for policy detection and enforcement, and it coordinates with Collector.

* *Admission controller*:
The admission controller prevents users from creating workloads that violate security policies in {product-title-short}.

* *Collector*:
Collector analyzes and monitors container activity on cluster nodes.
It collects information about container runtime and network activity and sends the collected data to Sensor.

* *Scanner* (only on {ocp}):
On {ocp}, RHACS installs a lightweight version of Scanner on each secured cluster (_Figure 1_) to enable scanning of images in the integrated OCR.

Figure 2 depicts the architecture in a non-OCP Kubernetes environment, where you only install the Scanner centrally.
