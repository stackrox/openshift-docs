= Creating a security policy from the system policies view

You can create new security policies from the system policies view.

.Procedure
. On the RHACS portal, navigate to *Platform Configuration* -> *Policies*.
. Click *Create policy*.
. Enter the following details about your policy in the *Policy details* section:
** Enter a *Name* for the policy.
** Optional: Attach notifiers to the policy by selecting from the available *Notifiers* under the *Attach notifiers* section.
+
[NOTE]
====
You must integrate {product-title} with your notification provider, for example, webhooks, Jira, PagerDuty, Splunk, or others before you can forward alerts.
====
** Select a *Severity* level for this policy, either `Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, or `Low`.
** Select policy *Categories* you want to apply to this policy.
** Enter details about the policy in the *Description* box.
** Enter an explanation about why the policy exists in the *Rationale* box.
** Enter steps to resolve violations of this policy in the *Guidance* box.
** Optional: Under the *MITRE ATT&CK* section, select the tactics and the techniques you want to specify for the policy.
.. Click *Add tactic*, and then select a tactic from the dropdown list.
.. Click the *Add technique* to add techniques for the selected tactic. You can specify multiple techniques for a tactic.
. Click *Next*.
. In the *Policy behavior* section, select the *Lifecycle stages* and *Event sources (Runtime lifecycle only)* for the policy.
** Choose *Lifecycle Stages* to which your policy is applicable, from *Build*, *Deploy*, or *Runtime*.
You can select more than one stage.
*** Build-time policies apply to image fields such as CVEs and Dockerfile instructions.
*** Deploy-time policies can include all build-time policy criteria but they can also include data from your cluster configurations, such as running in privileged mode or mounting the Docker socket.
*** Runtime policies can include all build-time and deploy-time policy criteria but they can also include data about process executions during runtime.
. For *Response method*, either select:
.. *Inform* to include the violation in the violations list.
.. Or select *Inform and enforce* to enforce actions.
*** Choose the enforcement behavior for the policy.
It is only available for the stages you select when configuring *Lifecycle Stages*.
Select *ON* (enable) to enforce policy and report a violation, and *OFF* (disable) to only report a violation.
The enforcement behavior is different for each lifecycle stage.
**** *Build* - {product-title} fails your continuous integration (CI) builds when images match the conditions of the policy.
**** *Deploy* - {product-title} blocks creation of deployments that match the conditions of the policy.
In clusters with admission controller enforcement, the Kubernetes or {ocp} API server blocks all noncompliant deployments.
In other clusters, {product-title} edits noncompliant deployments to prevent pods from being scheduled.
**** *Runtime* - {product-title} kills all pods that match the conditions of the policy or blocks the action taken on the pods.
+
[WARNING]
====
Policy enforcement can impact running applications or development processes.
Before you enable enforcement options, inform all stakeholders and plan about how to respond to automated enforcement actions.
====
. Click *Next*.
. In the *Policy Criteria* section, configure the attributes that you you want to trigger the policy for.
. Click *Next*.
. In the *Policy scope* section, configure the following:
** Click *Add inclusion scope* to use *Restrict to Scope* to enable this policy only for a specific cluster, a namespace, or a label.
You can add multiple scopes and also use regular expressions in link:https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax[RE2 Syntax] for namespaces and labels.
** Click *Add exclusion scope* to use *Exclude by Scope* to exclude deployments, clusters, namespaces, and labels you specify, it means that the policy will not apply to the entities that you select.
You can add multiple scopes and also use regular expressions in link:https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax[RE2 Syntax] for namespaces and labels.
However, you cannot use regular expressions for selecting deployments.
** For *Excluded Images (Build Lifecycle only)*, select all images that you do not want to trigger a violation for.
+
[NOTE]
====
The *Excluded Images* setting only applies when you check images in a continuous integration system with the *Build* lifecycle stage.
It does not have any effect if you use this policy to check running deployments in the *Deploy* lifecycle stage or runtime activities in the *Runtime* lifecycle stage.
