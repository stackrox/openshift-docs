[role="_abstract"]
{product-title} ({product-title-short}) comes with role-based access control (RBAC) that you can use to configure roles and grant various levels of access to {product-title} for different users.

[IMPORTANT]
====
In {product-title} 3.63, a scoped access control feature has been added.
If you are using {product-title} 3.63 or newer, see xref:../../operating/manage-user-access/manage-role-based-access-control-3630.adoc#manage-rbac-3630[Managing access control in {product-title} 3.63 and newer].
====

In {product-title} 3.0.62 and older, different roles govern access to {product-title} resources to prevent unwanted access.

* _Roles_ are a collection of rules, which are a group of `read` and `write` permissions that a user can perform on a set of resources.
* _Resources_ are the functionalities of {product-title} for which you can set view (`read`) and modify (`write`) permissions.
See the Resource definitions section to understand the access level that each permission grants.
//TODO: Add link to Resource definitions
